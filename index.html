			<p>
				It is logical to conclude that this diet has a positive impact on the skin. By consuming healthy fats
				and lowering sugar consumption, inflammation and oxidative stress will decrease. The keto diet may
				also prevent skin cancers, improve acne, and lessen the appearance of varicose veins.

			<h3>Veggie Protein Bowl</h3>
			<p>
				A healthy ketogenic diet should consist of about 75% fat, 10-30% protein and no more than 5% or 20 to
				50 grams of carbs per day. Focus on good-fat, low-carb foods like eggs, meats, dairy and low-carb
				vegetables, as well as sugar-free beverages. Be sure to restrict highly processed items and
				unhealthy fats.
